### What is Peano's Curve?
* Peano's Curve is a fractal pattern based on a line segment
* In each iteration, the line is divided into three parts and a pair of squares is created on each side of the middle segment
* It is called a space-filling function because after many iterations, it appears to fill in a square completely
* For this program, n = 5 should be sufficient to show the space-filling nature of this function
